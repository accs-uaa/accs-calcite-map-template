These instructions will enable you to deploy the ACCS Calcite Map on a server.

### Prerequisites

2. If necessary, update the relative path links in the map.html to reflect the locations of the Calcite Maps Framework and the custom.css.
3. Update all placeholder text fields in map.html to reflect the content.
4. Add a web map using the following steps:
    * Make a map using ArcGIS online and share publicly
    * Go to ArcGIS online rest url for the webmap: https://accsmaps.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/**"webmap-id"**/data?f=pjson
